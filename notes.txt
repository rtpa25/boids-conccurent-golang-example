There are two types of communication media:= Message passing like channels and shared memory
To create a motion where all the boids are gradually approching each other we need to have an average velocity of a group of boids. The group is formed between all the boids in the same view radius. Once all the boids in one viewRadius are known then we can calculate the avg velocity of all the boids in that region and then adjust the velocity of the target boid to that of the group avg velocity by simply subtracting it with the delta multiplied with a adj rate inorder to have a smooth transtition
